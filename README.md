# Air-Quality-Index---Python-Tableau-Power-Point

The Air Quality Index (AQI) can vary for different gases such as O3 (ozone), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), and CO (carbon monoxide). The AQI is a standardized measurement used to provide a simple and consistent way to understand air quality and its potential health effects.

The AQI is typically calculated based on the concentration of specific air pollutants, including ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), and sometimes other pollutants. Each of these pollutants has its own health effects and can originate from different sources.

To calculate the AQI, the concentration of each pollutant is compared to national or local air quality standards. The highest measured concentration among the pollutants is used to determine the overall AQI value. This value is then translated into a categorical rating, such as "Good," "Moderate," "Unhealthy," etc., which helps to communicate the air quality level to the general public.

Different gases have different levels of health risks associated with their concentrations. For example, ozone (O3) at high levels can cause respiratory problems, especially for individuals with asthma or other lung conditions. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are primarily released from burning fossil fuels and can contribute to respiratory issues and the formation of smog. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a toxic gas produced by incomplete combustion and can be harmful at high concentrations.

Therefore, the AQI values for each of these gases will be determined by their respective concentration levels and the associated health effects. It's worth noting that the AQI can also be influenced by other factors such as particulate matter and meteorological conditions, which can further impact air quality.

### O3 (Ozone):

Environmental: Ozone is formed in the atmosphere through complex reactions involving sunlight, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from various sources. It is not directly emitted by specific sectors or activities but forms due to the interaction of pollutants in the presence of sunlight. Ozone levels can be influenced by factors such as weather conditions and long-range transport of pollutants.

### CO (Carbon Monoxide):

Vehicular/Transportation: Carbon monoxide is primarily produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, particularly in vehicles and transportation-related activities. It is released from exhaust emissions of cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other motor vehicles.

Household: Carbon monoxide can also be emitted from sources within households, such as malfunctioning or poorly vented fuel-burning appliances (e.g., gas stoves, furnaces, and fireplaces) or the burning of biomass (e.g., wood and charcoal) indoors without adequate ventilation.

### SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide):

Industrial: Sulfur dioxide is primarily emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels, especially those containing high sulfur content, such as coal and oil. It is released by industrial processes such as power generation, manufacturing, and the burning of fossil fuels in industrial facilities.

### NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide):

Vehicular/Transportation: Nitrogen dioxide is produced from the combustion of fossil fuels at high temperatures, primarily in vehicles. It is a prominent component of vehicle exhaust and is released during the combustion of gasoline and diesel in cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other motor vehicles.

Industrial: Nitrogen dioxide can also be emitted from industrial activities such as power generation, manufacturing, and other combustion processes.
